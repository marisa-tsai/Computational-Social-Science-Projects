If we convert this column to a categorical variable, and create dummies, it will create a rather sparse matrix (many 0s in our dataset) becuase there will be 49 dummy variables.

    "**MODEL DESCRIPTION(S):** \n",
    "1.\tLinear Regression:\n",
    "•\tLogic and Assumptions: Linear regression tries to predict your outcome based on your predictors by creating a straight line. The parameters for the line is such that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. Assumptions include homoskedasticity, independence of observations, and normality of residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPros: Simple to understand, suitable for variables with linear relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCons: Cannot capture more complex, non-linear relationships between variables, not suitable for outcomes that are not continuous. In situations where relationship is close to linear, OLS tends to have low bias but high variance\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tChoice: Based on our scatter plots of Diabetes_Number and Obesity, and Diabetes_Number and Physical Inactivity, there appears to be strong positive linear relationships between those variables. So, I would try linear regression as my first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tLASSO:\n",
    "•\tLogic and Assumptions: Shrinks coefficient estimates towards 0 to reduce variance, more likely to shrink coefficients down to 0 (fewer features) than ridge. The second term that is added to the RSS involves an absolute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPros: reduced variance compared to OLS, better bias-variance tradeoff, won’t include all predictors in the model (unlike ridge)improved model interpretation and allows for feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCons: Slight increase in bias\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tChoice: There are many possible features for this model, so to reduce the risk of overfitting, we should take advantage of this method’s regularization. \n",
    "3.\tRidge:\n",
    "•\tLogic and Assumptions: Shrinks coefficient estimates towards 0 to reduce variance by a constant amount. The second term that is added to the RSS involves a squared value.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPros: Reduced variance compared to OLS, better bias-variance tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCons: Slight increase in bias, cannot be used for feature selection so harder to interpret results.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tChoice: There are many possible features for this model, so to reduce the risk of overfitting, we should take advantage of this method’s regularization. \n",

    "The bias-variance tradeoff is the phenomenon that methods with low bias often have high variance and methods with low variance often have high bias. Our goal in finding a good statistical learning method is to find a method with low bias and low variance. We generally find that statistical learning methods tend to perform the best at intermediate levels of model complexity. This is relevant to machine learning problems like ours, because it motivates methods like ridge and LASSO that can reduce variance at the cost of increasing bias. These methods can prevent overfitting, which often precede poor performance in test set data."

    "Overfitting is when a model follows the noise, or random errors in a dataset (as opposed to actual properties of a function). We often get this if the model we fit is too flexible. This is an issue because an overfit model will not perform well on any data that it wasn’t originally trained on and will not be good at predicting for new data. If there is a low training MSE and high test MSE, there may be overfitting. We can address it by using techniques with regularization capabilities, like LASSO and ridge."

    "For our analysis, we first cleaned the data. This included steps such as transforming some string variables into numeric types (e.g., integer or float), creating larger categories for some categorical variables (e.g., states into regions), dropping duplicate variables, and creating necessary dummy variables, among other steps. Then, we partitioned the data into a 60% train—20% validation—20% test for training. Next, we trained our models using the training data we had just partitioned with different types of models: linear regression, lasso, and ridge. Taking the 3 trained models, we made predications with the validation set, plotted the predictions vs actual values, and calculated the root mean squared errors. After finding that ridge performed the best, we removed the less important features from it, retrained it (repeating the processes previously described), and predicted on the test data. Finally, we ran a cross-validation and found that the best hyper parameters were alpha =1, keeping the intercept, and Singular Value Decomposition Solver.\n",

Looking at the counties that are in the top 10% of predicted diabetes rates, the southeast comprises 52% and the South makes up 43%. Another way to look at it, that isn’t influenced by number of counties per region, is via the empirical cumulative density function plot above.\n",

    "My answers would likely change if I took certain demographic features into account. For example, diabetes is higher among older people, so if it was simply the case that the Southwest and South had a higher proportion of older people, this might change my intervention strategy. I would not be very confident employing this in the real world because I have not accounted for important demographic features. I would also want to look at existing programs and recent trends.\n"
